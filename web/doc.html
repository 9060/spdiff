      <h2>Overview</h2><!-- the problem -->

      <h3>Is this tool for you?</h3>

      <p>If you can answer yes to most of the following questions,
      then you might find this tool (or the general problem
      addressed by it) interesting.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Have you ever developed a program that made use of some
        library?</li>

        <li>Have you ever had to update your program because of
        changes in the library you used?</li>

        <li>Have you ever been frustrated that the required changes
        you had to make in your program because of the mentioned
        library changes were not clearly documented?</li>

        <li>Have you ever felt annoyed that none of the many other
        people using the same library decided to document how they
        adapted their programs to the new version of the
        library?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The problem</h3>

      <p>The basic problem addessed by the spdiff tool is automatic
      inference of high level specifications of changes to
      structured data. We have mainly been concerned with C
      programs for the time being, but there seems to be no reason
      why the techniques described here could not also apply to
      other forms of structured data than C programs.</p>

      <p>In our setting a set of programs and their updated
      versions is given as a set of pairs of programs</p><code>C =
      { (p_1,p_1'), ... , (p_n,p_n') }</code>

      <p>The goal is now to find a specification of what changes
      were applied in all programs. This specification can serve as
      both a high level documentation of the common changes applied
      to the programs but also as the base for transforming other
      programs similarly.</p>

			<p>To get an intuition for what <code>spdiff</code> can examples can be
			useful...</p>	

      <div id="examples">
        <h2>Examples</h2>

				<p>Suppose we have the following three C programs. The programs have
				been constructed to illustrate points not to be interesting or sensible
				programs.</p>

        <table class="code">
          <tr>
            <th>Program 1</th>

            <th>Program 2</th>

            <th>Program 3</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>
<!-- p1.c -->
<pre>
int foo(void) {
  int x;
  f(x);
  x = f(x);
  x = g(117);
  return x;
}
</pre>
            </td>

            <td>
<!-- p2.c -->
<pre>
int bar(int y) {
  int a;
  a = f(a);
  a = f(a)+g(y);
  return a;
}
</pre>
            </td>

            <td>
<!-- p3.c -->
<pre>
int smoz(int y) {
  int z;
  z = f(z);
  z = f(z);
  return z;
}
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Now, further suppose that each program is updated into
        the following:</p>

        <table class="code">
          <tr>
            <th>Program 1'</th>

            <th>Program 2'</th>

            <th>Program 3'</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>
              <!-- p1'.c -->
              <pre>
int foo(void) {
  int x;
  f(x);
  x = f(x, 42);
  x = h(g(117));
  return x+x;
}
</pre>
            </td>

            <td>
              <!-- p2'.c -->
              <pre>
int bar(int y) {
  int a;
  a = f(a,42);
  a = f(a)+g(y,y);
  return a+a;
}
</pre>
            </td>

            <td>
              <!-- p3'.c -->
              <pre>
int smoz(int y) {
  int z;
  z = f(z);
  z = f(z, 42);
  return z+z;
}
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>We can express the changes of each program using generic
        patches in the following way (recall that by convention
        capital letters are meta-variables.</p>

        <table class="code">
          <tr>
            <th>1 to 1'</th>

            <th>2 to 2'</th>

            <th>3 to 3'</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>
              <!-- program 1 to 1' -->
              <pre>
    void ==&gt; int
    f(X) ==&gt; f(X,GFP)
  g(117) ==&gt; h(g(117))
return X ==&gt; return X+X
</pre>
            </td>

            <td>
              <!-- program 2 to 2' -->
              <pre>
    g(Y) ==&gt; g(Y,Y)
    f(X) ==&gt; f(X,GFP)
return X ==&gt; return X+X
</pre>
            </td>

            <td>
              <!-- program 3 to 3' -->
              <pre>
       * ==&gt; /
    f(X) ==&gt; f(X,GFP)
return X ==&gt; return X+X
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Two changes occur in all three changesets above:
        <code>f(X) ==&gt; f(X,GFP)</code> and <code>return X =&gt;
        return X+X</code>. We can put those term replacement
        patches in sequence and obtain what we call the largest
        common subpatch relative to the set of programs given:
        <code>f(X)==&gt;f(X,X);return X==&gt;return X+X</code>.</p>

        <h3>Example Usage</h3>

        <p>In this example we will use the spdiff tool to infer the
        result given in the above example (<a href=
        "#examples">ex</a>).</p>

        <p>Suppose the files <code>prg1.c, prg1.c.new, prg2.c,
        prg2.c.new, prg3.c, prg3.c.new</code> with the contents as
        in the example programs above are in the same
        directory.</p>

        <p>First, we need a <code>specfile</code> for the tool. A
        <code>specfile</code> is simply a list of the file pairs to
        analyse. It corresponds to the set <code>C</code>.</p>

        <p>Thus, make a file "<code>files</code>" in the same
        directory as the files above with the content:</p>
        <pre>
prg1.c prg1.c.new
prg2.c prg2.c.new
prg3.c prg3.c.new
</pre>

        <p>Now we are ready to run the tool. Try it with:</p>
        <pre>
spdiff -specfile files -top 14 -depth 4 -fixed -prune
</pre>

        <p>We return to what those parameters mean shortly. The
        returned result should be (not including some initial
        messages about type information and other output from the
        program):</p>
        <pre>
[Main] solution #1
{{{
        return[(X0:int)] ==&gt; return[(X0:int)+(X0:int)]
        f((X0:int)) ==&gt; f((X0:int),GFP)
}}}
</pre>

        <p>The result is a generic patch consiting of two term
        replacements.</p>

        <p>The first term replacement matches <code>return</code>
        statements returning an expression of type <code>int</code>
        and turns them into a <code>return</code> statement that
        returns the sum of the original expression added to
        itself.</p>

        <p>The second term replacement matches calls to
        <code>f</code> with one parameter of type <code>int</code>
        and replaces those calls with a call to <code>f</code> with
        two identical versions of the original argument.</p>

        <p>We now turn to the specific parameters given in the
        above command. All of the parameters are related to
        performance. In general the problem is (most likely) NP
        hard:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt><code>-top 14</code></dt>

          <dd>This indicates the size of the largest term to try to
          perform abstraction in. For very large terms, there can
          be many possible valid ways to introduce metavariables
          and <code>spdiff</code> will try all of them (see the
          depth paramenter below though). This may not be feasible
          when you already know that there will be no common term
          replacement for very large terms.</dd>

          <dt><code>-depth 4</code></dt>

          <dd>This parameter tells the function introducing
          metavariables to always introduce metavariables for
          subterms which are at the specified depth. Thus with
          depth 2 <code>f(g(h(42)))</code> would become
          <code>f(g(X))</code>. Higher values for this parameter
          increases the precision, but may also increase running
          time. The defaut value is 4.</dd>

          <dt><code>-fixed</code></dt>

          <dd>The <code>-fixed</code> parameter allows the
          abstraction of terms to <strong>not</strong> abstract
          subterms that are common in the dataset. The intuition is
          that since the subterm is common, it is somehow
          important. You almost always want to set this parameter.
          In future versions of the tool it will either default to
          being set or be removed completely.</dd>

          <dt><code>-prune</code></dt>

          <dd>This boolean parameter tells the inference algorithm
          to try to prune parts of the search space by various
          methods. Settings this parameter can drastically decrease
          running time.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Unparsing</h3>

        <p>The pretty printing part of <code>spdiff</code> is
        currently not very faithful to the original input
        programs.</p>

        <p>Programs are translated to an internal tree structured
        representation which has the following abstract syntax:</p>
        <pre>
gt      ::= A(type,value) | C(type, gt_list)
gt_list ::= gt | gt, gt_list
</pre>

        <p>A printing function for this simple structure is defined
        as follows (where type information is not completely
        used):</p>
        <pre>
let pp_tree t = match t with
  | A(t,v) -&gt; v
  | C(t,gts) -&gt; t ^ "[" ^ concat "," (map pp_tree gts) ^ "]"
</pre>

        <p>In the example above, the update to the
        <code>return</code>-statement is therefore printed as:</p>
        <pre>
        return[(X0:int)] ==&gt; return[(X0:int)+(X0:int)]
</pre>

        <p>For some cases (such as function calls) the printing
        function has special cases not shown above which makes the
        printed result look more like valid C code.</p>
