		<h2>The original commit</h2>
		<p>The commit with git SHA1 identification code
		  01f2705daf5a36208e69d7cf95db9c330f843af6	(<a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commitdiff;h=01f2705daf5a36208e69d7cf95db9c330f843af6;hp=38a23e311b6cd389b9d8af2ea6c28c8cffbe581c">patch</a>) was the
			first in a series of standard patches committed starting in May 2007 to
			the Linux version control system that implemented a refactoring of a
			commonly occurring pattern for clearing pages found in filesystem code.
			</p>
			<p>
				This pattern consisted of the following operations: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li> map a page into the kernel virtual memory using kmap_atomic,</li>
				<li>clear this page using memset, </li>
				<li>call flush_dcache_page to ensure that the cleared memory gets
					written to disk, and</li>
				<li>unmap the memory region using kunmap_atomic.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			The refactoring introduced a new function, zero_user_page that does all
			of these operations. Core kernel locations where memory was cleared in
			this way were modified to use the new function. In subsequent commits,
			the remaining locations were updated to use the new function. 
		</p>
		<h2>The inferred semantic patch</h2>
		<p>
			Running spdiff with a change set that consists of 4 pairs of the original
			and updated versions of some function that was modified by the above
			commit produces the semantic patch below:</p>
		<pre>
      @@
        expression X0, X1;
        struct page *X2;
        char *X3;
      @@
        - X3 = kmap_atomic(X2, KM_USER0);
        ...
        - memset(X3 + X0, 0, X1);
        ...
        - kunmap_atomic(X3, KM_USER0);
        + zero_user_page(X2, X0, X1, KM_USER0);
		</pre>
		<p> Note that the generated semantic patch does not include the call to
			flush_dcache_page. As this call occurs in varying positions relative to
			the call to kunmap_atomic â€“ and it even absent in one case, it is
			therefore excluded from the initial semantic pattern, and subsequently
			never occurs in the generated semantic patch.  </p>
	
		<p>Applying the inferred semantic patch to the files mentioned in the
			original commit causes it to perform a safe part of the changes that were
			made by hand, in all but one case. This case is represented by the
			following excerpt of the standard patch:</p>	
		<pre>
      @@ -2108,10 +2100,8 @@ int cont_prepare_write(
      - kaddr = kmap_atomic(new_page, KM_USER0);
      - memset(kaddr+zerofrom, 0, PAGE_CACHE_SIZE-zerofrom);
      - flush_dcache_page(new_page);
      - kunmap_atomic(kaddr, KM_USER0); 
      + zero_user_page(page, zerofrom, PAGE_CACHE_SIZE - zerofrom, KM_USER0); 
		</pre>
		<p> This standard patch code contains a small bug, that is not detected at
			compile time and thus only manifests itself at run-time. The error is
			that in the added code at the end of the standard patch, the first
			argument to zero_user_page is page, while, as shown by the other calls,
			it should have been new_page. The updated function can still be compiled
			because the variable page is a parameter of the function being modified.
			At run-time, however a file system corruption occurs, as described in the
			log message associated with commit
			ff1be9ad61e3e17ba83702d8ed0b534e5b8ee15c (<a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commitdiff;h=ff1be9ad61e3e17ba83702d8ed0b534e5b8ee15c;hp=5f663404b27fa72546a592c5c932b0605b9c93a6">patch</a>). </p>
		<p>This error would have been avoided if the change were made using the
			semantic patch, because the semantic patch specifies that the first
			argument to the newly inserted function call should be the same as the
			first argument to the call to kmap_atomic. Since in all other updated
			functions the name of the variable given as the first argument to
			kmap_atomic is indeed page, the bug is probably a result of  copy-paste
			editing. Linux code frequently but not always uses stereotypical names
			for values of a given type, and thus there is a high potential for this
			sort of copy-paste editing error.
